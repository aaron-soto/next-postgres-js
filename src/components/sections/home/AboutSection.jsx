              ” - A native to Phoenix, AZ and world class woodworker. He wanted
              a space for clients to come in and enjoy the furniture instead of
              admiring from a screen. As the local community&apos;s curiosity
              brought them in, they were in “awe” of not only the woodworking
              but also the specialty coffee! They quickly demanded that it be
              open to the public for everyone&apos;s enjoyment! The people have
              spoken, and the rest is history. This concept has since been
              re-created by other craftsman as William&apos;s case study yet
              again paved the way.
